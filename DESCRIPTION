Description: NBN Atlas provides tools to enable users
    of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and visualise data on
    United Kingdom and Ireland plants and animals; these have been made available from
    <https://nbnatlas.org/>. NBN4R provides a subset of the tools based on the ALA4R
    package which can be directly used within R. It enables the R community to 
    directly access data and resources hosted by the NBN. Our goal is to enable
    outputs (e.g. observations of species) to be queried and output in a range of 
    standard formats.
